 <h1>Jim McKeown</h1>
 <p id="p1">Jim has led Masinyusane as CoFounder and Director for the past 11 years, building an organization that creates opportunities for others: the opportunity to get an education, to develop one's talents, and to reach one's potential in life. </p>
  
  ​​
  
  Jim arrived in Port Elizabeth from New York in 2008 after leaving behind a promising career on Wall Street. He possesses an MA in Development Studies (Nelson Mandela University), a BSc in Operations & Research Engineering (Columbia University, NY), and a BA in Computer Engineering (Fairfield University, CT).
  
   
  
  What drove Jim to come to South Africa was to be able to provide the same type of opportunities for others that he received growing up in the United States.  Upon arriving,
  he met some amazing people (see Fiks below!) who shared the same passion and belief in uplifting others through education. 
  
  ​
  
  His embrace of the townships of Port Elizabeth has been all in. Jim has lived in the townships, adopted kids, embraced the culture, and even learned the local language, isiXhosa.
